[Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) is easily integrated with open source projects in order to have metrics and distributed tracing.

The following scenario demonstrates how to:

- Expose Envoy's statistics in [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).  

- Use prometheus datasource to build dashboards in [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).

- Configure envoy to send traces to [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/).
