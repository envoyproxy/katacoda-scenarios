Unlike active health checking, *Outlier Detection* (sometimes called passive health checking) uses the responses from real requests to determine whether an endpoint is healthy. Once an endpoint is removed, Envoy uses a time-out based approach for re-insertion, where unhealthy hosts are re-added to the cluster after a configurable interval. Each subsequent removal increases the interval, so a persistently unhealthy endpoint does as little damage as possible to user traffic.

Like health checks, outlier detection is configured per-cluster. This configuration removes a host for 30 seconds when it returns 3 consecutive 5xx errors:

Open the file `envoy1.yaml`{{open}} and add the following configuration:

<pre class="file" data-filename="envoy1.yaml" data-target="append">
    outlier_detection:
        consecutive_5xx: "3"
        base_ejection_time: "30s"
</pre>

The key fields are:

* **consecutive_5xx**: If an upstream host returns some number of consecutive 5xx, it will be ejected. Note that in this case a 5xx means an actual 5xx respond code, or an event that would cause the HTTP router to return one on the upstreamâ€™s behalf (reset, connection failure, etc.).

* **base_ejection_time**: The base time that a host is ejected for. The real time is equal to the base time multiplied by the number of times the host has been ejected. Defaults to 30000ms or 30s.
